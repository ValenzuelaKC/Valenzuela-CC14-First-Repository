    <h1 class="headings1">Who am I?</h1>
    <p> I am Kyle Christian R. Valenzuela. I am currently a college student in Univesity of the Cordilleras, taking a degree program of Bachelor of
      Science in Information Technology, Major in Network and Security Track.<br><br>
      My advocacy is to inform everyone about Human Rights and let them know their basic rights
      under this law. I ought to educate everyone the misconcepcion about Human Rights and how not to abuse it but
      rather use it accordingly for reasonable and just situations that will conform to the
      constitution.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2 class="headings">Vision</h2>
    <p>To have a peaceful world without affecting others rights as every individual has the liberty to have equality and fairness.
    </p>
    <h2 class="headings">Mission</h2>
    <p>To promote and spread awareness about understanding of having rights and freedom.
    </p>
    <h2 class="headings">Goal</h2>
    <p>To implement what must be done without affecting others' rights as we must always put it in our minds that we must consider all of us and not just ourselves.
    <h2 class="headings">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Human rights are fundamental guidelines for conduct in certain areas that are widely acknowledged to be important. Everyone must follow the rules of conduct that the world has established for all of us, as these requirements are known as human rights.
