      <br><h1>Human Rights Consideration</h1>
      <p>Since the principle of human rights focuses on equality and fairness, everyone has the privilege to have it. Yet, there will be consequences that might occur, which will disrupt the pinnacle meaning of human rights. And that is when an individual’s right is being degraded which violates the principle of equality and fairness. As humans, we must take note that we should still consider others when making an action. As it might be good for yourself but harm others, which in an instance you yourself violate theirs.
